Intro.
I made this chess GUI as the final project for my MATLAB computing class.
You must download the entire repo,  open the "chessmatch.mlapp" file, and run that file in the app window.
A pop-up with the game should be generated for you to play.

Gameplay.
Using lowercase letters, enter the square of the piece you would like to move and the location that you would like to move it to.
The game checks for move legality, so no cheating!
The game ends when you take the opponent's king.
